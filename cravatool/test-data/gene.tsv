#Gene Level Annotation Report
#2018-07-16 14:46:40.327272
#CRAVAT version: hybrid
#Analysis done at http://www.cravat.us.
#Job Id: rsajulga_20180716_104621
#Input file: Freebayes_min.vcf
#This report shows analysis results at gene level.
#The composite p-value (Stouffer's combined p-value) and composite FDR of a gene show how probable it is to get the same p-value distribution for the gene as that obtained from the input variants by chance.
#hg38 genomic.
